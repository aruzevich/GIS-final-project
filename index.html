    <h2>Mount Leuser</h2>
    <p>Gunung Leuser National Park is one of the richest tropical rainforests in Southeast Asia.
      Covering up to 7927 km2 and straddling the border of North Sumatra and Aceh provinces, it
      is one of the last places on earth with critically endangered orangutans living in the wild.
      This region is also the habitat of other wildlife: Elephants, rhinos, tigers, siamangs, Thomas
      leaf monkeys, macaques and gibbons are just a handful of the thousands of species found in
      this unique eco-system. Together with Bukit Barisan Selatan and Kerinci Seblat National Parks,
      Gunung Leuser National Park is an UNESCO World Heritage Site (listed 2004), a Tropical Rainforest
      Heritage of Sumatra.</p>
    <p>

      </div>
    </p>
    <p>The park area peaks at 3,404 m with the summit of Gunung Leuser which gave the area its name. Its wide range of eco-systems contains rivers, volcanoes and lakes. This rainforest is immensely biodiverse, hosting approximately 750 different species of animals – more than 200 mammals, 380 birds, 190 reptiles and amphibians. Because of the great differences in altitude and the diversity in soil, the Gunung Leuser National Park also has an enormous wealth of plant species. 45% of all recorded plant species in the West Indo-Malayan region are found in this area.</p>

    <h2>Kerinci Seblat</h2>
    <p>Of Indonesia’s lesser-visited parks, Kerinci Seblat in West Sumatra shelters Sumatran
      elephants and tigers, clouded leopards, Malayan sun bears and tapirs, as well as hundreds
      of species of birds, and the world’s largest and tallest flowers. There are no orangutans,
      but occasionally sightings have been reported of the mysterious orang pendek, a bipedal ape
      similar to an orangutan, and the mythical sigau, half-lion and half-tiger.</p>
    <p>

      </div>
    </p>
    <p>The park is one of Indonesia’s largest reserves, covering an incredible 14,000 sq km (5,400 sq miles)
      of jungle and mountains. It is home to the highest peak in West Sumatra, Gunung Kerinci. The second
      highest volcano in Indonesia, Kerinci attracts climbers who are up for a serious challenge.
      Conservation groups here have trained local guides to take the adventurous on treks through the
      forest and climbing expeditions.</p>

    <h2>Way Kambas</h2>
    <p>In South Sumatra, on the island's southwest coast, Way Kambas is a sanctuary for Sumatran
      elephants and rhinos, assuring visitors of the chance to spot them. The park comprises estuaries,
      marshes and open grassland and is the home of the Sumatran Rhino Sanctuary, which plays an
      important part in the ongoing efforts to save the Sumatran rhino from extinction. </p>
      <p>Here, it is possible to spot wild elephants, boars, and tigers that come to the river’s edge to drink. Birdwatching is
        also excellent, with resident kingfishers, lesser adjutants, woolly-necked storks and pelicans.
        The park also houses an Elephant Conservation Centre, in which the endangered mammals are bred and
        trained to patrol park boundaries.</p>

    <h2>Ujung Kulon</h2>
    <p>A UNESCO Natural Heritage Site, Ujung Kulon National Park is located south of Carita on the
      southwest tip of Java. A 420 sq km (260 sq mile) reserve, it supports the gravely endangered and
      rarely sighted Javan one-horned rhino – of which fewer than 70 remain – and numerous other forest
      species. The area includes Java’s largest lowland rainforests, home to hornbills, deer, wild boar,
      black panthers and green turtles. Other wildlife resident in the park includes leopards, macaques,
      leaf monkeys, crocodiles and indigenous wild oxen (banteng).</p>
    <p>While much of the area is dense lowland rainforest, there are also open woodlands and wetlands –
      excellent habitats for birdwatching – with beaches in the north and south. Thousands of migratory birds flock in
      to the nearby islands of Pulau Dua and Pamojan Besar between April and August. Offshore, Krakatau Island
      also makes up part of the park.</p>

    <h2>Meru Batiri</h2>
    <p>The Meru Betiri National Park in eastern Java covers 580 sq km of magnificent coastal rainforest and abundant wildlife.
      It’s famous as having been one of the last refuges of the Javan tiger, now almost certainly extinct.
      Meru Betiri is very difficult to access (often impossible in the rainy season), which keeps the number of visitors
      to a trickle, but the park authorities are actively trying to promote tourism.</p>
    <p>At Meru Betiri, one can find rare plants such as the Raflesia Zollingeriona flower,
      Balanphora Fungosa, mangrove forest, api-api, waru, nyamplung, rengas, and several types of medicinal
      plants. There are also long-tailed macaques, ajag, lekang, and turtles that lay their eggs on the beach.</p>

    <p>The island of Borneo is a remarkable island in general for its century-old cloud forests.
      The 4150 sq km forested expanses of Tanjung Puting National Park in Central Kalimantan are known for
      the abundant wildlife they support, especially orangutans. In addition, with its swamps, mangroves, rivers, and
      rainforests, there’s plenty to discover in this large park.</P>
    <p>Sunrise along the river offers the best opportunity for seeing proboscis monkeys, birds, mudskippers, archerfish, and pythons.</p>

    <h2>Komodo</h2>
    <p>A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Komodo National Park lies in the strait between Sumbawa and Flores in the Lesser Sunda Islands.
      It is the best known for being the natural habitat of the world’s largest reptile, the Komodo dragon. This giant carnivorous monitor lizard is
      one of the world’s oldest species, and a close relative of the dinosaurs that roamed the earth 100 million years ago.
      Komodo National Park receives very little rainfall, which results in an arid landscape you won’t find elsewhere in
      Indonesia.

    <h2>Lorentz</h2>
    <p>Lorentz National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Papua province. At 2.5 million ha
      (6.2 million acres), it is the largest protected area in Southeast Asia. The park is one of
      the most ecologically diverse in the world, its vast expanses encompassing tropical marine
      environments and lowland wetlands, as well as Indonesia’s highest mountain, Puncak Jaya,
      which reaches 4,884 metres (16,024ft) and is capped by permanent ice fields. The mountain
      is the tallest peak between the Himalayas and the Andes, and one of only three equatorial
      glaciers on the planet.
    <p>The extraordinary biodiversity of the park supports numerous rare animals such as
      crowned pigeons and birds of paradise. It is also home to a number of isolated tribes,
      including the Amungme, Western Dani, Nduga, Ngalik, Asmat, Mimika and Somohai.</p>

    <h2>Wasur</h2>
    <p>The wetlands situated within the Wasur National Park are the least disturbed in Indonesia.
      Located in the Papua province, the park is a vast and incredibly biodiverse ecosystem.
      It is so rich with wildlife and vegetation that it is often referred to as the ‘Serengeti
      of Papua’. The official name of the park – Wasur – is derived from the Maori word <em>waisol</em>,
      which means garden. Within the park, the Rawa Biru Lake hosts the largest range of plant and
      animal species.</P>
    <p>

      </div>
    </p>
    <p>Roughly 70% of the park is made up of savanna territories – open canopy plains that consist
      of a mixture of grasslands and woods. The remaining 30% are grassy plains, monsoon forests,
      swamp forests, coastal forests and bamboo forests. Most of the plants found in the Wasur National
      Park are mangroves, which provide a vital habitat for a large variety of birds and fish.
      Wildlife include the southern cassowary, wallaby, blue crowned pigeon, several species of bird of
      paradise, saltwater crocodiles, and the New Guinea crocodile. Rare species that are endemic to
      the area include the southern crowned pigeon, dusky pademelon, New Guinea harpy eagle, black-necked
      stork, little curlew and Fly River grassbird.</p>

  <section id="conclusion"></br>
    <h2>Threats to Biodiversity</h2>
    <p>Notwithstanding the numerous parks and other conservation areas, many of Indonesia's
      most treasured species are classified as endangered or critically endangered. Despite
      legal environmental protections, the threat of extinction looms large over much of the
      country's flora and fauna due to rapid industrialization and human population growth.
      Factors such as illegal deforestation, agricultural expansion, industrial pollution,
      illegal wildlife poaching, and natural hazards due to climate change all contribute to the dwindling
      populations of rare animal species.</p></br>

    <p>The impacts of losing Indonesia's––and indeed, the world's––biodiversity are inestimable. Beyond the designation of national parks and other
      conservation areas, it is crucial for Indonesia to implement stronger regulations, monitoring mechanisms, and rule of law around natural resource management and development
      to avoid the slow degredation of its natural wonders.</p></br>
